# 9 Box Puzzle

The **9 Box Puzzle** is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with numbered boxes from 1 to 8 in random order, with the 9th box missing. The goal is to arrange the boxes in ascending order by sliding them into the empty space. The fewer the moves, the better the score! The boxes can only move vertically or horizontally, and diagonal movements are not allowed.
